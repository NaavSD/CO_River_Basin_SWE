## Description
Dataset represents presence of bat species as determined from acoustic
  

monitoring. Detectors were deployed at sites within National Forests according
  

A Plan for the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) guidelines.
  

Acoustic data were screened and analyzed by Christen Long, Bat Conservation International. Data were analyzed to determine species present per night. Map symbols represent detector locations. For more information at each site, click the info tab, and then draw a box around your area of interest.
